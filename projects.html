										<img src="images/ux_collegepro.png"></a>
										<p>(11/2018) CollegePro was an Interaction Design group project. We conducted surveys for students to provide insight in designing and prototyping a website, CollegePro, that aims to centralize information resources regarding academic advising, career, and research in a personalized way and allows students to communicate with others.</p>
