										<p>
										Inspired by the popularization of augmented reality (AR) in 2017, my undergrad senior capstone group project was SounD CHK, a multimedia digital magazine app that implemented a QR Code Reader that accompanied a physical zine (which was also designed and published by my group).<br><br>
										I did the <b>wireframing</b>, <b>designing</b>, and <b>development</b> of the mobile application (on Android).</p>

									<h3>RaceTrack (in progress)</h3>
									<img src="images/rt_supporter.png">
									<p class="click_link"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19levb1a_6mtE6_NHZthA5nHDfPOpI323" target="_blank"><b>Mid-Fi Report</b></a></p><br>
									<p>
										My Prototyping and Implementation group project is RaceTrack, a mobile and smartwatch application that helps runners stay motivated by getting detailed feedback on their performance and connecting them to their family, friends,and/or coaches for support during racetime through cheers. A user could create an account as a Runner,
										Supporter, or Coach, but would have the option to switch between modes.<br><br>
										Each member of my group conducted an <b>in-person think-aloud usability test</b> with a participant on a medium-fidelity prototype of RaceTrack. The sessions were recorded through screen and audio capture, and
										data collection focused on interactions, navigational choices, and task completion success.<br><br>
										I'm currently part of a 4-person group, where the workload for <b>prototyping</b> and <b>data collection and analysis</b> was split equally, but I'm primarily focused on implementing the Supporter role interfaces (displayed on the image).

										<p>
										PlayerSync was a solo term project for my Social Interaction Design course. I created a prototype in Adobe XD for a mobile app that matches the user to other gamers/players based on personal gaming preferences and behaviors. It aims to centralize communication across all existing gaming platforms.<br><br>For this project, I created a <b>persona</b>, both <b>low-fidelity</b> and <b>high-fidelity prototypes</b>, and conducted a <b>think-aloud observation</b> and <b>interview</b>.</p>

										<p>
										CollegePro was an Interaction Design group project. We conducted <b>surveys</b> for students to provide insight in <b>wireframing, prototyping, and designing</b> a website, CollegePro, that aims to centralize information resources regarding academic advising, career, and research in a personalized way and allows students to communicate with others.</p>

								<li class="cont_1"><h3>Personal Website (this)</h3>
										<p>This website was designed and coded by me to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be a lifelong ongoing project as my career progresses. &#9786; My long-term goal is to clean the code and include search and filter features for the Portfolio and Blog sections and continuously improve on its usability. With the time I have now, I've mostly focused on simplicity.</p>
