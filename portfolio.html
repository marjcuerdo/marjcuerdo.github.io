								<b>Main Research Question:</b> Why was <i>Ghostbusters (2016)</i> received poorly by players?<br><br>Attempting to answer this overall question involved doing an extensive project that required four distinct stages.<br><br>
								<b>Methods: </b><br>

									<li>1. Competitive Review</li>
									<li>2. Heuristic Evaluation<li>
									<li>3. Usability Test</li>
									<li>4. Playtest</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								Every UX research method had its own evaluation round, in which <i>subsequent research questions/objectives were built from the previous round's findings</i>. The presentation link has summary slides of each stage, and the full report link (submitted for the course) contains rich details for design recommendations and artifacts such as test plans, moderator guide, consent form, protocols, and surveys. I used DePaul's Software Observation and Usability Lab (SOUL) to conduct the tests.

								<b>Abstract</b>
								<p>At the heart of failure in many game genres is player death. This chapter presents our exploration into the space of player death and rebirth through the creation of a generalized taxonomy of death in platformer games---one of the genres that features player death and respawning most heavily. In order to create this taxonomy, we collected and catalogued examples of respawning mechanics from 62 recent platformer games released on the digital distribution platform Steam after January 2018. Games selected varied equally across positive, mixed, and negative overall reviews in order to provide a broader range of mechanics, both good and bad. We observed gameplays of each individual game and noted the processes of death and rebirth respectively. A grounded theory approach was then employed to develop the taxonomy of game death and respawning, resulting in five notable dimensions: 1) death conditions, 2) respawn locations, 3) changes to player progress, 4) obstacles, and 5) aesthetics. Finally, we argue how the different dimensions and mechanics highlighted in our taxonomy have substantial implications for key aspects of player experience such as flow and enjoyment, and discuss how they could be used to improve the effectiveness of related techniques such as dynamic difficulty adjustment.<br><br>
								
								Professor Melcer and I worked on this project together. We had iterative discussions on data obtained from observations and developed a codebook to create the taxonomy. I hope to extend the work by developing a platformer game, where I modify conditions for a death and rebirth mechanic, and gather data on player experiences that result from that.

								<b>Abstract</b> 
								<p>While it is highly likely that children under the age of 12 have used a mobile device in the U.S., there is a paucity of information to guide interaction designers and usability experts about how to design and test their mobile apps with children. In this work (currently a pilot study), I have conducted user testing of mobile-based apps aimed at computational thinking with two different age groups (7-8 and 9-11). The pilot study will lay a foundation for an envisioned larger project that will result in developmental-focused interaction design guidelines for mobile apps; future work will include creating and testing the efficacy of a tool for designers to access the guideline libraries. This study also contributes to the knowledgebase of user testing with children; specifically, we are working to modify and adapt the System Usablity Scale (SUS) for these two groups.<br><br>
								There were 3 other RAs involved in this project. As an RA, I moderated in-lab studies with children and their parents, as well as assisting in qualitative analysis and writing.
