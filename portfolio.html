										<b>Abstract.</b> At the heart of failure in many game genres is player death. This chapter presents our exploration into the space of player death and rebirth through the creation of a generalized taxonomy of death in platformer games---one of the genres that features player death and respawning most heavily. In order to create this taxonomy, we collected and catalogued examples of respawning mechanics from 62 recent platformer games released on the digital distribution platform Steam after January 2018. Games selected varied equally across positive, mixed, and negative overall reviews in order to provide a broader range of mechanics, both good and bad. We observed gameplays of each individual game and noted the processes of death and rebirth respectively. A grounded theory approach was then employed to develop the taxonomy of game death and respawning, resulting in five notable dimensions: 1) death conditions, 2) respawn locations, 3) changes to player progress, 4) obstacles, and 5) aesthetics. Finally, we argue how the different dimensions and mechanics highlighted in our taxonomy have substantial implications for key aspects of player experience such as flow and enjoyment, and discuss how they could be used to improve the effectiveness of related techniques such as dynamic difficulty adjustment.</p>
