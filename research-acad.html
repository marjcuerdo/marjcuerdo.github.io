								<b>Description</b>
								<p>Failure is a central aspect of almost every game, driving player perceptions of difficulty and impacting core aspects of game user experience. At the heart of failure in many game genres is player death, and platformer games in particular rely heavily on the use of death within their design. This work addresses the rich, underexplored space of in-game death/failure (and respawning) through the creation of a generalized taxonomy of failure in platformer games. The taxonomy consists of five notable dimensions of a cyclical nature: (1) obstacles, (2) failure/death conditions, (3) aesthetics, (4) player progress, and (5) reset/respawn locations. These different dimensions have a number of potential implications for key aspects of player experience and design. The taxonomy could also be used to help improve the effectiveness of related engagement techniques such as dynamic difficulty adjustment.<br><br>

								We then explored how altering the consequences of death on player progress affected aspects of the player experience. Specifically, our research investigated the relationship of failure mechanics – the location of reset/respawn points – to player experience (PX) constructs, such as mastery, challenge, autonomy, curiosity, and immersion. We developed a simple 2D platformer game that only differed in reset point locations: the start of the game (permadeath), the start of a level, the last reached checkpoint, and the last manually saved point.<br><br>

									Storytelling elements in educational games and simulations have been found to make learning more meaningful. Previous work has also found that games can afford reflective, emotional experiences. Games that are emotionally-moving or challenging have been found to evoke long-lasting memories for players. Therefore, there is potential to harness the reflective powers of games for the design of serious games with an agenda. We are creating a game modifying rewind mechanics to observe whether they affect perceived challenge by players and whether they afford an increase in reflective and emotionally engaging experiences. To address emotional aspects of gameplay, we are creating a narrative game focused on the complex experiences of someone discovering that they have bipolar II disorder, given that it is commonly misdiagnosed simply as depression (major depressive disorder).

								<b>Abstract</b>
								<p>Tangible games afford an engaging and often unique
form of hybrid play (i.e., physical-digital elements), but there
is currently limited work explicitly exploring how these games
can be designed to provide spatial affordances that implicitly
encourage collaboration. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative tangible game, titled Mad Mixologist, and investigate
how making a simple change in the location of game objects
within the tangible play space can lead to significantly different
collaborative interaction strategies. The results from our group
comparison study indicate that 1) players with exclusively direct
access to multiple relevant resources (i.e., a digital instruction
and a physical object) were more likely to assume responsibility
for completing tasks in a shared play space and 2) distributing
these same task-relevant resources across multiple players created
ambiguity over whether the player with the digital or physical
resource should engage with the shared play space. This study
demonstrates one possible way in which the physical design of a
tangible game can be arranged to implicitly encourage players
to develop more collaborative interaction strategies, specifically
by distributing exclusive resources across players. Overall, this
study highlights and reinforces the connection between spatial
affordances and social interactions via embodied facilitation
within the context of collaborative tangible games.<br><br>
