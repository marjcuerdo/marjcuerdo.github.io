				<div id="blog_entry">It's 2:41am EST and this is my first entry! As a grad student, I tend to worry about time management a lot. I've always wanted to write about my experiences as a student, but I thought that I should strictly devote my time to coding or studying. However, self-reflection is valuable and can be motivating. I'm hoping that this entry will jumpstart my journey to creating a home for my thoughts primarily about computing, student life, games, and social issues involving tech. Right now, I'm typing this through Sublime, as I'm not planning on making my website go live yet until I've included more content. I just wanted to jot my thoughts down, because I'm really excited about the future! Though, it's weird to think that these thoughts won't be posted until later. Going to find as much time as possible to squeeze in finishing my website between learning SQL, reading/writing papers, and UX assignments for my grad courses.</div>
