					* Decided to be responsible and only take 2 grad classes this quarter -- UX Research Methods and Usability Evaluation Methods<br>
					* I am learning a lot everyday<br>
					* I am so excited<br>
					* I don't have much time right now to devote to improving this website, but I'll do the best I can this quarter! Hoping to take a Games UX course next quarter in Chicago, IL. Really trying to take the knowledge in to prepare<br>
					* I really want to start making a basic game soon</p></div><br>

					<div id="blog_entry"><p style="text-indent: 40px">My website is live! It's nowhere near the status that I wanted it to be at, but time is ticking while I'm at school and I wanted to make progress. I've added to the Projects page. It's still not window resizeable or mobile-friendly, so I'm hoping to make progress on that relatively soon. Keeping the design and aesthetics simple (Blue-Orange is accessible!)</p><p style="text-indent: 40px">In the meantime, the semester is winding down and preparing for end-of-term projects and papers for my classes: Interaction Design, Database Management Systems (SQL), and Management Information Systems. Looking forward to the end and taking a trip back to the Bay Area for the holidays. Go Warriors.</p></div><br>

					<div id="blog_entry"><p style="text-indent: 40px">It's 2:41am EST and this is my first entry! As a grad student, I tend to worry about time management a lot. I've always wanted to write about my experiences as a student, but I thought that I should strictly devote my time to coding or studying. However, self-reflection is valuable and can be motivating. I'm hoping that this entry will jumpstart my journey to creating a home for my thoughts primarily about computing, student life, games, and social issues involving tech.</p><p style="text-indent: 40px">Right now, I'm typing this through Sublime, as I'm not planning on making my website go live yet until I've included more content. I just wanted to jot my thoughts down, because I'm really excited about the future! Though, it's weird to think that these thoughts won't be posted until later. Going to find as much time as possible to squeeze in finishing my website between learning SQL, reading/writing papers, and UX assignments for my grad courses.</p>
