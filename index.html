					<p class="intro">I'm a <b class="job_title">UX Researcher</b>.<br><br>
					I empathize with people to better their <b class="job_title">engagement</b>, <b class="job_title">enjoyment</b>, and <b class="job_title">learning</b> with technology and digital media, especially in the form of <b class="job_title">games</b> and other <b class="job_title">immersive experiences</b>.</p>
					<p class="intro_2"> 
					I combine my <a href="portfolio.html">analytical</a> & <a href="design.html">creative</a> skills to understand both the user/player experience and the iterative research and design processes to make them enjoyable and intuitive. <br><br>
					
					I have an <a href="https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/MSinHuman-ComputerInteraction.aspx" target="_blank">M.S. Human-Computer Interaction</a> with a background in <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dms/index.html" target="_blank">digital media studies</a>. I'm also member of the <a href="https://altgameslab.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Alternative Learning Technologies and Games (ALT Games) Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>
					
					I'm interested in research related to games, player experience, XR (Mixed (<b class="job_title">MR</b>), Augmented (<b class="job_title">AR</b>), and Virtual (<b class="job_title">VR</b>) realities), and learning/education.<br>

					<br>I'm from the beautiful <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/04/saipan_n_4603094.html" target="_blank">Northern Mariana Islands</a>. Proud to be one of the recipients of the <a href="http://gmsp.org/" target="_blank">Gates Millennium Scholarship</a>.</p>
