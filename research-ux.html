							<b>Main Research Question:</b> What do digital content creators need to efficiently discover and edit music into their content, without requiring knowledge of music theory or composition?<br><br>
							<b>Methods: </b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Observations</li>
									<li>2. Interviews</li>
									<li>3. Surveys</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								I was part of an exploratory study about how content creators discover and add music and other auditory material to their work. The project resulted in recommendations towards designing an <b>intelligent digital media editing software</b>. This is the final report containing details about each stage of the process and our implications for design.<br><br>
								I was part of a 4-person group where the workload for obtaining data was split equally. I did a significant part of the qualitative and quanitative analysis.

								<b>Main Research Question:</b> How and why was the game design of <i>Ghostbusters (2016)</i> received poorly by critics and players?<br><br>Attempting to answer this overall question involved doing an extensive project that required four distinct stages.<br><br>
								<b>Methods: </b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Competitive review</li>
									<li>2. Heuristic evaluation<li>
									<li>3. Usability test</li>
									<li>4. Playtest</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								Every UX research method had its own evaluation round, in which <b>subsequent research questions/objectives were built from the previous round's findings</b>. The presentation link has summary slides of each stage, and the full report link (submitted for the course) contains more details for design recommendations and research artifacts such as test plans, moderator guide, consent form, protocols, and surveys. I used DePaul's Software Observation and Usability Lab (SOUL) to conduct the tests.

								</ul>
									<br>
										My MS HCI Prototyping and Implementation course group project was <i>RaceTrack</i>, a mobile phone and smartwatch application that helps runners stay motivated. It gave detailed feedback on runner performance and connecting them to their family, friends, and/or coaches for support during racetime. A user could create an account as a Runner,
										Supporter, or Coach, but would have the option to switch between modes.<br><br>
										Each member of my group conducted an <b>in-person think-aloud usability test</b> with a participant on a medium-fidelity (mid-fi) prototype of <i>RaceTrack</i>. The sessions were recorded and
										data collection focused on interactions, navigational choices, and task completion success.<br><br>
										I was part of a 4-person group, but I was primarily focused on implementing the Supporter role interfaces (mid-fi version displayed above) and UX research.

								<b>Research Questions: </b><br>
									<ul class="list">
										<li>Can players understand the main game mechanic of "tethering" (i.e. attaching oneself to another body)?</li>
										<li>Can players understand consequences of failure in the game?</li>
										<li>Can players understand the objectives despite the intentional aesthetic ambiguity of the game?</li>
										<li>Can players navigate the game user interface?</li>
										<li>Can players navigate the game map?</li>
									</ul>
								<br>
								<b>Method:</b> Usability test<br><br>
								This game was an early build of a senior undergrad Game Development capstone project. At the time, the game dev students wanted help mainly with usability issues, as the game was intentionally made dark to support its ghost-like narrative. I again used DePaul's SOUL lab.

								<b>Methods: </b><br>

								<br>
								This game was another early build of a senior undergrad Game Development capstone project. The game dev students were in the later stages of their process and were interested in primarily assessing the player experience (enjoyment and aesthetics) of their game, but also identifying usability issues that they may have missed. I again used DePaul's SOUL lab to do this study.
