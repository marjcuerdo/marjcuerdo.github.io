								<b>Research Questions: </b><br>
									<ul class="list">
										<li>What needs do patients in DBT-focused mental health recovery programs have?</li>
										<li>How can games or other types of playable media assist in practicing DBT and/or CBT skills?</li>
										<li>How can games lead to an increase in learning outcomes of DBT and/or CBT skills?</li>
										<li>Would games implicitly foster social connection during therapy?</li>
										<li>Would games increase the levels of engagement and enjoyment patients have?</li>
									</ul>

								<ul>
									<li>1. Interviews</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
									The ongoing COVID-19 has brought discussions about mental health to the forefront, though it has always been a pressing issue in our society. Depression and anxiety are ravaging our population along with coronavirus itself. Fortunately, there are mental health recovery programs that assist in helping people develop coping skills from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). These skills are used to overcome thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that impede health. I am developing a research study to discover ways that games and playable media can help people practice aspects of DBT/CBT skills in an engaging and enjoyable way through eliciting <u>perceived cognitive, emotional, and decision-making challenge</u>. I am currently in the <b>generative research phase</b> for this project.

							<b>Main Research Question:</b> What do digital content creators need to efficiently discover and edit music into their content, without requiring knowledge of music theory or composition?<br><br>
							<b>Methods: </b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Observations</li>
									<li>2. Interviews</li>
									<li>3. Surveys</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								I was part of an exploratory study about how content creators discover and add music and other auditory material to their work. The project resulted in recommendations towards designing an <b>intelligent digital media editing software</b>. This is the final report containing details about each stage of the process and our implications for design.<br><br>
								I was part of a 4-person group where the workload for obtaining data was split equally. I did a significant part of the qualitative and quanitative analysis.

								<b>Main Research Question:</b> Why was <i>Ghostbusters (2016)</i> received poorly by players?<br><br>Attempting to answer this overall question involved doing an extensive project that required four distinct stages.<br><br>
								<b>Methods: </b><br>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Competitive Revi+ew</li>
									<li>2. Heuristic Evaluation<li>
									<li>3. Usability Test</li>
									<li>4. Playtest</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								Every UX research method had its own evaluation round, in which <i>subsequent research questions/objectives were built from the previous round's findings</i>. The presentation link has summary slides of each stage, and the full report link (submitted for the course) contains rich details for design recommendations and artifacts such as test plans, moderator guide, consent form, protocols, and surveys. I used DePaul's Software Observation and Usability Lab (SOUL) to conduct the tests.

									<p><b>Methods: </b>think-aloud usability test, interviews, observation, prototyping, data analysis<br><br>
										My Prototyping and Implementation group project is RaceTrack, a mobile and smartwatch application that helps runners stay motivated by getting detailed feedback on their performance and connecting them to their family, friends,and/or coaches for support during racetime. A user could create an account as a Runner,
										Supporter, or Coach, but would have the option to switch between modes.<br><br>
										Each member of my group conducted an in-person think-aloud usability test with a participant on a medium-fidelity prototype of RaceTrack. The sessions were recorded through screen and audio capture, and
										data collection focused on interactions, navigational choices, and task completion success.<br><br>
										I was part of a 4-person group, but I was primarily focused on implementing the Supporter role interfaces (mid-fi version displayed on the images).

It aims to centralize communication across all existing gaming platforms.</p>

								<b>Research Questions: </b><br>
									<ul class="list">
										<li>Can players understand the main game mechanic of "tethering" (i.e. attaching oneself to another body)?</li>
										<li>Can players understand consequences of failure in the game?</li>
										<li>Can players understand the objectives despite the intentional aesthetic ambiguity of the game?</li>
										<li>Can players navigate the game user interface?</li>
										<li>Can players navigate the game map?</li>
									</ul>
								<br>
								<b>Method:</b> Usability Test<br><br>
								This game was an early build of a senior undergrad Game Development capstone project. At the time, the game dev students wanted help mainly with usability issues, as the game was intentionally made dark to support its ghost-like narrative. I again used DePaul's SOUL lab.

								This game was another early build of a senior undergrad Game Development capstone project. The game dev students were in the later stages of their process and were interested in primarily assessing the player experience (enjoyment and aesthetics) of their game, but also identifying usability issues that they may have missed. I again used DePaul's SOUL lab to do this study.
